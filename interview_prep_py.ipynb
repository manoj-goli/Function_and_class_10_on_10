    "Round 1: Technical Assessment - in your preferred coding language Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical Solutions Engineer (TSE)\n",
    "The Mission: Acting as a deep technical investigator, diving into existing systems and codebases to diagnose the root cause of urgent failures.\n",
    "The Format: Applied Code Comprehension You will be presented with a scenario (e.g., a buggy code snippet or a failing system) and asked to analyze it. Use this 5-step troubleshooting process:\n",
    "Scoping Questions: Understand the system’s current state vs. expected behavior before diagnosing.\n",
    "\n",
    "System-Level Metrics: Identify the bottleneck. Is it CPU, memory, network, or storage? Use math to validate if a component is overloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trace Interactions: Trace a user request from the load balancer to the database. Show you understand how the storage model impacts performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify Failure Patterns: Explain what the pattern suggests (e.g., a connectivity issue vs. a processing bottleneck).\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate Trade-offs (Systems Thinking): Connect the failure to original design choices. For example: \"If the system prioritizes consistency, what failures is it now susceptible to?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What the Interviewer is Looking For:\n",
    "Bug/Fix Identification: Can you find all bugs and propose clear fixes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Proactive Improvement: Are you suggesting ways to refactor for better long-term health?\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Rationalization: Can you use O-notation to justify proposed changes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Universal Success Tips:\n",
    "Think Out Loud: This is not a silent test. Narrate your work, your assumptions, and your decisions continuously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical Precision: Use industry terminology correctly. If you are unsure of a term, ask for clarification—don't guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 4-Step Problem Solving Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand: Ask clarifying questions to define constraints and ambiguities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plan: Discuss multiple potential solutions/causes and their trade-offs. Justify why you chose one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Propose: Present your answer (Clean code for CPSE; Root cause/fix for TSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "Validate: Articulate how you would test your solution and account for edge cases. \n",

    "6. Optimize if I can\n",

    "By looking at the code, it I am guessing the difficulty will be 3/10 or 4/10\n",

    "There will be \n",
    "- 1 major bug\n",
    "- 1 logic error\n",
    "- 1 edge case scenario where the code can break\n",
    "- And with room to optimize \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I am still at level either 1/10 or 2/10, I have couple of days of time to ramp up. Train me with code snippets and provide me to the point feedback as well as rating on my effort on a scale of 1(poor) to 10 (good).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets start with difficulty of 2/10 with various TSE scenarios one by one and eventually try doing 5/10. After my final submission of each snippet, take my confirmation and provide feedback. Between the snippet and to my final response submission, you act as interviewer to my clarification/scoping questions."
