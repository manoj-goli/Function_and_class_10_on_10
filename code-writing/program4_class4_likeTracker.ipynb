    "# The time complexity of the like and unlike methods is O(1) because they involve adding or removing an element from a set, which is a constant time operation because sets in Python are implemented as hash tables.\n",

    "# The time complexity of the like_count method is O(n) where n is the number of likes in the LikeTrace set, because it iterates through all the likes to count how many times a specific post_id appears.\n",
    "# The space complexity of the LikeTracker class is O(m) where m is the number of unique (user_id, post_id) pairs in the LikeTrace set, because each like is stored as a tuple in the set."

    "Clarifying Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Is this for a real-time system like Instagram where like counts need to be immediately visible to users, or can there be some delay in count updates?\n",
    "Do we need to show which specific users liked a post (like clicking on the like count to see names), or just the total count?\n",
    "Should users be able to see if their friends liked a post, or just their own like status?\n",
    "\n",
    "how would you do back of the design calculations without knowing the as-is infrastructure or constraints?\n",
    "You're absolutely right - I can't do meaningful back-of-the-envelope calculations without knowing the constraints! That's why I asked those clarifying questions first.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scale estimates completely depend on the answers. For example:\n",
    "If it's Instagram-like: 500M+ daily active users, each liking maybe 5-10 posts per day → billions of likes\n",
    "If it's a small startup: 10,000 users, each liking 2 posts per day → 20,000 likes\n",
    "\n",
    "What I actually need to know before calculating anything:\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected user base - Is this for a global social network or an internal tool?\n",
    "Peak traffic patterns - Are there viral events where a post gets millions of likes in minutes?\n",
    "Geographic distribution - Users concentrated in one region or worldwide?\n",
    "Data persistence requirements - Do we need to keep likes forever, or can we archive old data?\n",
    "Without these, any calculations would just be guesses!\n",
    "\n",
    "what about their as-is infra, do you need that info or not? if yes, when would you ask that question.\n",
    "Yes, I need that info - but at a specific time.\n",
    "When I would ask it: After understanding the scale and requirements, but BEFORE finalizing the design.\n",
    "Why not earlier? Because if they're building this from scratch, there is no \"as-is\" infra! The question only makes sense if:\n",
    "They're adding this feature to an existing system, OR\n",
    "They have existing infrastructure we must work within (like \"we only use AWS\", or \"we have 10 on-prem servers\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Example timeline:\n",
    "First: Clarify requirements (users, traffic, features) ✅ (just did this)\n",
    "Then: Do rough scale estimates\n",
    "Then: Ask about as-is infra - \"What existing infrastructure/components can we leverage? Any constraints on tech stack?\"\n",
    "Finally: Design the system\n",
    "So you're right - I should ask about existing infra AFTER understanding the problem scope, not before!"
