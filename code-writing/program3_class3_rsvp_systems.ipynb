    "Here’s the context (as if I’m the hiring team / product owner answering your clarifying questions):\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) What is the existing setup?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Today it’s basically what you coded: **one service instance** keeping RSVPs **in memory** (no database).\n",
    "* It restarts sometimes (deploys/auto-healing), so data can be lost.\n",

    "\n",
    "  * `POST /events/{event_id}/rsvp`\n",
    "  * `DELETE /events/{event_id}/rsvp`\n",
    "  * `GET /events/{event_id}/rsvp_count`\n",
    "  * `GET /events/{event_id}/users/{user_id}` (has_rsvped)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Main choke/pain points?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Memory limit** (can’t store enough RSVP pairs).\n",
    "* **Single point of failure** (one instance dies → feature down).\n",
    "* **No durability** (restart = data loss).\n",
    "* **Hot events**: a small % of events get *huge* traffic spikes (think concert tickets).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Any SLOs / SLAs?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Availability: **99.9%** monthly for RSVP feature.\n",
    "* Latency targets (p95):\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `has_rsvped`: **< 50 ms**\n",
    "  * `rsvp/cancel`: **< 150 ms**\n",
    "  * `rsvp_count`: **< 100 ms**\n",
    "* Consistency expectations:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * For a single user: after they RSVP/cancel, **their own `has_rsvped` should reflect it quickly** (within ~1s).\n",
    "  * `rsvp_count` can be **slightly stale** (up to ~5 seconds) during traffic spikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Cost constraints?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reasonable cost sensitivity: “don’t build a super expensive system for a simple feature.”\n",
    "* Prefer **managed services** where it makes sense.\n",
    "* Start **single-region**; have a **disaster recovery plan**, but not active-active multi-region on day 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now move to **Step 2: NALSD (back-of-the-envelope math)**.\n",
    "Give me your assumptions + rough numbers for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* total RSVPs stored\n",
    "* peak reads/writes per second\n",
    "* storage size estimate\n",
    "* hottest-event spike estimate\n"
