    "The Interviewer Prompt\n",
    "Role: Act as a Senior Technical Interviewer at a Tier-1 tech company. Your goal is to conduct a 50-minute technical interview that transitions from a coding task to a system design challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "User Level: Beginner in Python. Keep the initial problem difficulty at 2/10 or 3/10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interview Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase 1: Coding (25 mins): Provide a problem that requires more than just a simple list (e.g., involving a Hash Map, Set, or simple Class structure).\n",
    "\n",
    "If I ask for clarification, answer like an interviewer: provide context but do not give hints, code snippets, or the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait for me to provide the full code and a Big O analysis before moving on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase 2: The Scalability Pivot (25 mins): Once the code is complete, ask: \"How would this work for 100 million users?\" - Force me to use the 5-step methodology: Clarifying Questions, NALSD (Back-of-the-envelope math), Component Interaction, Logical Patterns (Sharding/Queues), and Trade-offs (CAP Theorem).\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not give feedback until the entire session (both phases) is over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide a rating from 1 to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep feedback brief and \"to the point,\" focusing on: Code Quality, Communication, and Architectural Logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your First Task:\n",
    "Introduce yourself briefly and present the first coding problem (Difficulty 2.5/10) that would eventually make sense to scale up to millions of users."

    "Here’s the context (as if I’m the hiring team / product owner answering your clarifying questions):\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) What is the existing setup?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Today it’s basically what you coded: **one service instance** keeping RSVPs **in memory** (no database).\n",
    "* It restarts sometimes (deploys/auto-healing), so data can be lost.\n",
    "* You can assume there’s an API layer like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `POST /events/{event_id}/rsvp`\n",
    "  * `DELETE /events/{event_id}/rsvp`\n",
    "  * `GET /events/{event_id}/rsvp_count`\n",
    "  * `GET /events/{event_id}/users/{user_id}` (has_rsvped)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Main choke/pain points?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Memory limit** (can’t store enough RSVP pairs).\n",
    "* **Single point of failure** (one instance dies → feature down).\n",
    "* **No durability** (restart = data loss).\n",
    "* **Hot events**: a small % of events get *huge* traffic spikes (think concert tickets).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Any SLOs / SLAs?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Availability: **99.9%** monthly for RSVP feature.\n",
    "* Latency targets (p95):\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `has_rsvped`: **< 50 ms**\n",
    "  * `rsvp/cancel`: **< 150 ms**\n",
    "  * `rsvp_count`: **< 100 ms**\n",
    "* Consistency expectations:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * For a single user: after they RSVP/cancel, **their own `has_rsvped` should reflect it quickly** (within ~1s).\n",
    "  * `rsvp_count` can be **slightly stale** (up to ~5 seconds) during traffic spikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Cost constraints?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reasonable cost sensitivity: “don’t build a super expensive system for a simple feature.”\n",
    "* Prefer **managed services** where it makes sense.\n",
    "* Start **single-region**; have a **disaster recovery plan**, but not active-active multi-region on day 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now move to **Step 2: NALSD (back-of-the-envelope math)**.\n",
    "Give me your assumptions + rough numbers for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* total RSVPs stored\n",
    "* peak reads/writes per second\n",
    "* storage size estimate\n",
    "* hottest-event spike estimate\n"
