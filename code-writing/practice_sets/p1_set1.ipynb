    "Hello, thanks for joining. I'm a senior engineer on the backend team. For the first 25 minutes, we're going to do a quick coding exercise. Please share your screen or open a text editor where you're comfortable writing Python.\n",

    "We have a social media startup where users can follow each other. We need a basic feature to analyze these connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem:**\n",
    "Write a function called `get_recommendations` that takes two inputs:\n",
    "1.  `user_id` (a string/integer representing the current user).\n",
    "2.  `graph` (a dictionary where the keys are user IDs, and the values are lists of users they follow).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function should return a list of users that the current user *does not already follow*, but who are followed by at least one of the users that the current user *does* follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words: **\"Recommend the accounts that my followees follow, but I don't follow yet.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "graph = {\n",
    "    \"A\": [\"B\", \"C\"],\n",
    "    \"B\": [\"C\", \"D\"],\n",
    "    \"C\": [\"E\"],\n",
    "    \"D\": [\"F\"],\n",
    "    \"E\": [],\n",
    "    \"F\": []\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# If the current user is \"A\":\n",
    "# - \"A\" follows [\"B\", \"C\"]\n",
    "# - \"B\" follows [\"C\", \"D\"]\n",
    "# - \"C\" follows [\"E\"]\n",
    "# - Combined followees of B and C: [\"C\", \"D\", \"E\"]\n",
    "# - Remove users A already follows: [\"B\", \"C\"] \n",
    "# - Remove A themselves? (Optional, but we usually filter out self. Let's filter self out for clarity)\n",
    "# - Result: [\"D\", \"E\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Take your time to read the prompt. Let me know when you are ready to start coding, or if you have any clarifying questions about the input/output format."
