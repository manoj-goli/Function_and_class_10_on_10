    "Nice improvement. You fixed several important interview-level issues.\n",

    "## Score\n",
    "\n",
    "**7/10**\n",
    "\n",
    "## What improved\n",
    "\n",
    "* You now **return** the dictionary ✅\n",
    "* You switched to an **`elif` chain**, so only one command path runs ✅\n",
    "* You added an **unknown command** check ✅\n",
    "* You moved closer to using **`ValueError`** for invalid input ✅\n",
    "* The code is still readable and follows your original structure ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "## What still needs tightening\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`WITHDRAW` check is still incorrect**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * You check:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * `if output[name] < 0`\n",
    "   * But at that point you have **not subtracted yet**\n",
    "   * You need to check whether the withdrawal would make it negative\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Still using wrong exception types in 2 places**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `raise TypeError(\"Type error\")` → should be **`ValueError`**\n",
    "   * `raise Exception(\"OPENING TWICE! not allowed\")` → should be **`ValueError`**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Unused variable still there**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `len1 = len(commands)` is still unused\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Extra print**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `print(output)` is not part of the function contract\n",
    "   * In interviews, returning the result is cleaner unless printing is required\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **This part is unnecessary / awkward**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `or None` in:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * `if not line or line.startswith(\"#\") or None:`\n",
    "   * It does nothing useful\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 quick tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* Before updating state, ask: **“Have I validated enough?”**\n",
    "* Match the requested API exactly: **return type, exception type, no extra output**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall\n",
    "\n",
    "This is real progress. You are clearly improving between reps, and that matters more than speed right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do one more cleanup pass on the **same code** and only fix these:\n",
    "\n",
    "* withdraw condition\n",
    "* exception types\n",
    "* remove unused variable\n",
