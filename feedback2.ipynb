    "Here’s the full list of Python concepts that you got wrong or struggled with **more than once** (from this thread + your recent practice in the last ~7 days). Some you’ve already improved on — I’m still listing them because they were recurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data types and conversions\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`str` vs `int` vs `float` mismatches** (especially when comparing / doing math)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `sys.argv[...]` is always **str** until you cast\n",
    "  * parsed fields from `.split()` are **str** until you cast\n",
    "* **Lexicographic comparisons** (strings compared like words, not numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `\"10\" < \"2\"` being `True` surprised you a few times\n",
    "* **Bytes vs string from subprocess / I/O**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `subprocess.check_output()` default **bytes** vs `text=True` giving **str**\n",
    "* **Booleans behaving like ints**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `True == 1`, `False == 0` (showed up around sets / mixed types)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional logic (your biggest recurring theme)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`and` vs `or` in skip conditions**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `if not line and line.startswith(\"#\")` (almost always wrong)\n",
    "  * correct: `if not line or line.startswith(\"#\")`\n",
    "* **Inclusive vs exclusive thresholds**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * using `>` when the requirement is `>=` (error rates, stale counts, CPU thresholds)\n",
    "* **Truthiness gotchas**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * empty string `\"\"`, whitespace `\"  \"`, `0`, `None` behaving differently in `if x:`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parsing and data-shape discipline\n",
    "\n",
    "* **“Sanitize → validate/skip → parse” order**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * converting to `int(...)` *before* checking blank/comment lines (causes crashes)\n",
    "* **Hard-coded indexing after `.split()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * off-by-one errors: `parts[2]` vs `parts[3]` depending on format\n",
    "  * missing-length guard (`len(parts) < N`) leading to `IndexError`\n",
    "* **Malformed line handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * assuming every line has the same number of tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dictionaries (accumulation & iteration)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Classic accumulation bug**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `counts[k] = counts[k] + 1` when key doesn’t exist\n",
    "  * fixed pattern: `counts[k] = counts.get(k, 0) + 1`\n",
    "* **Understanding what iterating a dict gives you**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `for x in counts:` iterates **keys**\n",
    "* **`.get` vs `.keys()` / `.values()` and how they’re used**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * especially how `.get` can act as a callable for `sorted(..., key=...)`\n",
    "\n",
    "## `sorted()` + `key=` + `lambda` mental model (very recurring)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Passing the wrong thing to `key=`**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `key=counts.keys()` or similar (not a function)\n",
    "* **Sorting dict keys vs dict items**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `sorted(d)` vs `sorted(d.items())`\n",
    "* **Tie-breakers using tuple keys**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `key=lambda item: (-item[1], item[0])` not being automatic yet\n",
    "* **Data-shape mismatch after sorting**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * sorting `.items()` returns tuples, then printing as if they were keys (KeyError)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions, returns, and iterators\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Generator `yield` vs `return`**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * replacing `yield` with `return` changes it from producing many values to ending immediately\n",
    "* **Tuple returns and unpacking**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * returning `(alert, errors)` and then trying to call it like `func(...)(0)` instead of unpacking\n",
    "* **File handles are iterators**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * trying to read from the same file object twice after it’s already consumed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Edge cases you missed repeatedly (but started catching more)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Empty input → division by zero**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `avg = total / count` when `count == 0`\n",
    "* **Empty string indexing**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * doing `s[-1]` before checking `if not s:` (showed up in the “Bob” problem)\n",
    "* **External command failures**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `subprocess.CalledProcessError` not handled consistently\n",
    "* **Wrong exception type / not naming it precisely**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * interviewer asked for proper exception naming like `ValueError`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sets (you asked recently)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **“Set is mutable but items are not indexable / not ordered” confusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * “can’t change items” vs “can add/remove items” nuance\n",
    "* **Set operations outputs**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * intersection/difference mental model (you’re better now)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want, I can turn this into a targeted 1–2 day drill plan: **10 micro-snippets** covering just these failure patterns (each takes 2–3 minutes), with the same “major bug / logic error / edge case / optimize” rubric.\n"
