    "## **Kubernetes Error Codes & Exit Codes: The Interview Cheat Sheet**\n",
    "\n",
    "For your Google Kubernetes Technical Solutions Engineer interview, here are the **must-know** error codes categorized by what they tell you. I've focused on the ones that actually appear in debugging conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **📊 EXIT CODES (Container/Process Termination)**\n",
    "\n",
    "These come from `kubectl describe pod` or `kubectl get pod -o yaml`. The pattern: **128 + signal number** = exit code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔴 Memory & Resource Related**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Exit Code | Signal | Common Meaning | Kubernetes Status | Your Interview Soundbite |\n",
    "|-----------|--------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|\n",
    "| **137** | SIGKILL (9) | **OOMKilled** - Container exceeded memory limit | `OOMKilled` | \"Exit code 137 means 128+9—the OOM killer terminated the process. First check: are memory limits too low, or does the app have a leak?\"  |\n",
    "| **1** | - | General application error | `Error` or `CrashLoopBackOff` | \"Code 1 is the catch-all 'something went wrong'—app logs are your friend here.\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔴 Signal-Related (Kernel/System Kills)**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Exit Code | Signal | Common Meaning | Debugging Clue |\n",
    "|-----------|--------|----------------|----------------|\n",
    "| **134** | SIGABRT (6) | **Assertion failure** - Process aborted itself | Usually application bug, glibc detecting heap corruption  |\n",
    "| **139** | SIGSEGV (11) | **Segmentation fault** - Invalid memory access | Pointer bugs, library mismatches, native code issues  |\n",
    "| **143** | SIGTERM (15) | **Graceful termination requested** | Pod being shut down normally (128+15=143) |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔴 Configuration & Startup**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Exit Code | Meaning | Scenario | Fix |\n",
    "|-----------|---------|----------|-----|\n",
    "| **127** | Command not found | Entrypoint or command in pod spec doesn't exist in image | Check your image's PATH or the command spelling  |\n",
    "| **126** | Permission denied | Command exists but can't execute | File permissions, missing execute bit |\n",
    "| **0** | Success | Container exited normally | Jobs/CronJobs expected behavior |\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **📊 HTTP CODES (Service Exposure & Probes)**\n",
    "\n",
    "These appear in Ingress, Service, and Probe debugging.\n",

    "| HTTP Code | Context | What It Means | Interview Gold |\n",
    "|-----------|---------|---------------|----------------|\n",
    "| **503** | Readiness probe fails | App returned \"Service Unavailable\" during health check | \"A failing readiness probe with 503 tells me the app is alive but not ready for traffic—dependencies might be down.\"  |\n",
    "| **5xx** | Liveness probe fails | App in bad state, needs restart | Liveness triggers restart; readiness removes from service |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔵 Auth & Access (The 401/403 Distinction)**\n",
    "\n",
    "| HTTP Code | Kubernetes Context | Root Cause | Diagnostic Move |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------------|------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| **401 Unauthorized** | API Server requests | **Authentication failed** - Who are you? | Token expired, wrong credentials, missing auth header  |\n",
    "| **403 Forbidden** | API Server requests | **Authorization failed** - I know who you are, but you can't do that | RBAC missing, insufficient permissions  |\n",
    "| **401 vs 403** | **The interview soundbite** | *\"401 is 'who are you?', 403 is 'I know you, but NO.'\"* | This distinction alone shows depth |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world nuance**: A 403 from the API server on port 6443 could also mean a proxy is blocking you—check for `Via` or `X-Cache` headers in the response .\n",

    "### **🔵 Other Important HTTP Codes**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Code | Context | Meaning |\n",
    "|------|---------|---------|\n",

    "\n",
    "### **When you see...**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Exit Code 137 → \"OOMKilled. Memory limit or leak.\"\n",
    "Exit Code 143 → \"Graceful termination. Probably scaling down.\"\n",
    "Exit Code 1   → \"App error. Check logs.\"\n",
    "Exit Code 127 → \"Command not found in image.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "503 on readiness → \"App not ready. Dependencies?\"\n",
    "401 on API call   → \"Authentication failed. Token expired?\"\n",
    "403 on API call   → \"Authorization failed. RBAC missing.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Diagnostic Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **\"I look at three things: exit code tells me HOW it died, pod status tells me WHAT Kubernetes thinks, and logs tell me WHY.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Google-Grade Soundbite**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a 401 vs 403 question:\n",
    "> *\"401 is an authentication failure—the request lacks valid credentials. 403 is authorization failure—the credentials are valid, but the user doesn't have permission. In Kubernetes, I debug 401 by checking service account tokens or kubeconfig; 403 sends me straight to RBAC roles and bindings.\"* \n",
    "\n",
    "For OOMKilled (137):\n",
    "> *\"Exit code 137 = 128 + SIGKILL(9). The Linux OOM killer terminated the process. I immediately check if memory limits are too restrictive or if the application has a leak. The pod's QoS class tells me how it ranks for termination—Guaranteed pods are the last to go.\"* \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **📝 PRO TIP FOR THE INTERVIEW**\n",
    "\n",
    "When they ask about a failing pod:\n",
    "1. **Name the exit code** first (shows you know where to look)\n",
    "2. **Translate it** (137 → OOMKilled)\n",
    "3. **Explain the mechanism** (OOM killer, signal, etc.)\n",
    "4. **State your next action** (check limits, logs, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure alone signals senior-level troubleshooting."
