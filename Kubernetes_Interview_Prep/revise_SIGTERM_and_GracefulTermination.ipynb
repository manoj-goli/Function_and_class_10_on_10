    "I'll teach you about Kubernetes pod lifecycle management, focusing on graceful termination and lifecycle hooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **SIGTERM and Graceful Termination**\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is SIGTERM?\n",
    "SIGTERM (Signal Terminate) is a signal sent to a process to request its termination. In Kubernetes:\n",
    "- When Kubernetes decides to stop a pod, it sends a SIGTERM signal to the main process (PID 1) in each container\n",
    "- It's a polite request to shut down, not a forceful kill\n",
    "- The process can catch this signal and perform cleanup operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grace Period\n",
    "The grace period is the time Kubernetes gives your pod to shut down gracefully:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "apiVersion: v1\n",
    "kind: Pod\n",
    "metadata:\n",
    "  name: my-pod\n",
    "spec:\n",
    "  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30  # Default is 30 seconds\n",
    "  containers:\n",
    "  - name: my-container\n",
    "    image: nginx\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens during termination:**\n",
    "1. Pod is marked as \"Terminating\" and removed from service endpoints\n",
    "2. SIGTERM signal is sent to the container\n",
    "3. Kubernetes waits for `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` (default 30s)\n",
    "4. If container doesn't exit, SIGKILL is sent (forceful termination)\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Pod Lifecycle Hooks**\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes provides two lifecycle hooks that allow you to run code at specific points in a pod's lifecycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. PostStart Hook**\n",
    "Executes immediately after a container is created, but before the container's entrypoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "apiVersion: v1\n",
    "kind: Pod\n",
    "metadata:\n",
    "  name: lifecycle-demo\n",
    "spec:\n",
    "  containers:\n",
    "  - name: my-container\n",
    "    image: nginx\n",
    "    lifecycle:\n",
    "      postStart:\n",
    "        exec:\n",
    "          command: [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"echo 'Container started' > /startup.log\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important notes about PostStart:**\n",
    "- Runs asynchronously with the container's entrypoint\n",
    "- If the hook fails, the container is killed\n",
    "- No guarantee it runs before the entrypoint starts\n",
    "- Useful for:\n",
    "  - Registering the pod with a service registry\n",
    "  - Warming up caches\n",
    "  - Running initialization scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. PreStop Hook**\n",
    "Executes immediately before a container is terminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "apiVersion: v1\n",
    "kind: Pod\n",
    "metadata:\n",
    "  name: graceful-shutdown\n",
    "spec:\n",
    "  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 60\n",
    "  containers:\n",
    "  - name: my-app\n",
    "    image: my-app:latest\n",
    "    lifecycle:\n",
    "      preStop:\n",
    "        exec:\n",
    "          command: [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"sleep 10 && /usr/local/bin/cleanup.sh\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**PreStop behavior:**\n",
    "- Runs before SIGTERM is sent\n",
    "- Must complete within `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`\n",
    "- If it doesn't complete, SIGKILL is still sent after the grace period\n",
    "- Useful for:\n",
    "  - Draining connections\n",
    "  - Completing current requests\n",
    "  - Saving state\n",
    "  - Notifying other services\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Complete Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a comprehensive example showing both hooks and graceful termination:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "apiVersion: apps/v1\n",
    "kind: Deployment\n",
    "metadata:\n",
    "  name: web-app\n",
    "spec:\n",
    "  replicas: 3\n",
    "  selector:\n",
    "    matchLabels:\n",
    "      app: web-app\n",
    "  template:\n",
    "    metadata:\n",
    "      labels:\n",
    "        app: web-app\n",
    "    spec:\n",
    "      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 60  # Extended grace period\n",
    "      containers:\n",
    "      - name: web-app\n",
    "        image: nginx:latest\n",
    "        ports:\n",
    "        - containerPort: 80\n",
    "        lifecycle:\n",
    "          postStart:\n",
    "            exec:\n",
    "              command:\n",
    "              - /bin/sh\n",
    "              - -c\n",
    "              - |\n",
    "                echo \"Registering with service discovery\" &&\n",
    "                curl -X POST http://service-registry/register -d '{\"name\":\"web-app\"}'\n",
    "          \n",
    "          preStop:\n",
    "            exec:\n",
    "              command:\n",
    "              - /bin/sh\n",
    "              - -c\n",
    "              - |\n",
    "                echo \"Deregistering from load balancer\" &&\n",
    "                curl -X POST http://service-registry/deregister -d '{\"name\":\"web-app\"}' &&\n",
    "                echo \"Waiting for connections to drain\" &&\n",
    "                sleep 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Best Practices**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set appropriate grace periods**: \n",
    "   - Too short → processes get killed abruptly\n",
    "   - Too long → deployment updates are slow\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handle SIGTERM in your application**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import signal\n",
    "import time\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "def handle_sigterm(*args):\n",
    "    print(\"Received SIGTERM, cleaning up...\")\n",
    "    # Close database connections\n",
    "    # Finish current requests\n",
    "    sys.exit(0)\n",
    "\n",
    "signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, handle_sigterm)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Your application code here\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    time.sleep(1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **PreStop timeout considerations**:\n",
    "   - The total time (preStop execution + SIGTERM handling) must fit within `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`\n",
    "   - Example: If preStop takes 20 seconds, ensure terminationGracePeriodSeconds > 20\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Common patterns**:\n",
    "   - **Rolling updates**: New pods start, old pods get preStop hook to drain connections\n",
    "   - **Stateful applications**: Save data during preStop, restore during postStart\n",
    "   - **Service mesh**: Properly deregister from service mesh before termination\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Debugging Tips**\n",
    "\n",
    "Check pod events for hook failures:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "kubectl describe pod <pod-name>\n",
    "kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous  # Check logs of terminated container\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaway is that proper lifecycle management ensures your applications handle shutdowns gracefully, preventing data loss and providing better user experience during deployments or node failures."
