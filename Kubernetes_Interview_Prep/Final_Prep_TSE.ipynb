    "Below is your **table-of-contents mapped to TSE-style “scenario buckets”**, with **highest-ROI first** for a Google **Technical Solutions Engineer (Kubernetes)** interview. I’m keeping it **ops/troubleshooting focused** (not developer-heavy).\n",

    "## 1) Zero Downtime Deployments (Highest ROI)\n",
    "\n",
    "**From your TOC**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **9 Deployments: updating applications declaratively**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * 9.1 Updating apps in pods\n",
    "  * 9.3 Deployments: create/update, **rollback**, **control rollout rate**, **pause**, **block bad versions**\n",
    "* **17 Best practices**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * 17.2 Pod lifecycle (apps expect to be killed/relocated, rescheduling)\n",
    "  * 17.3 Handling requests during startup/shutdown (avoid broken connections)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this wins interviews (TSE scenario value)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many real scenarios are: *“new version rolled out → errors/spikes → how do you stop blast radius and recover?”*\n",
    "* You’ll demonstrate: **safe rollout mechanics**, **readiness-gated rollouts**, **rollback strategy**, and **how to keep traffic healthy** while changing the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you should sound like**\n",
    "\n",
    "* “I’d check rollout status/events, confirm readiness gates, pause rollout, rollback if needed, and validate service endpoints/metrics.”\n",

    "## 2) Self Healing (Very High ROI)\n",
    "\n",
    "**From your TOC**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **11 Understanding Kubernetes internals**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * 11.2 How controllers cooperate (chain of events, observing events)\n",
    "  * 11.1 What API server / scheduler / controller manager / kubelet do\n",
    "  * 11.6 Running highly available clusters (control plane HA concepts)\n",
    "* **10 StatefulSets**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * 10.5 How StatefulSets deal with **node failures**\n",
    "* **17 Best practices**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * 17.2 Pod lifecycle (killed/relocated, rescheduling of dead/partially dead pods)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this nails scenario questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* TSE interviews love: *“pods keep restarting”, “nodes flapping”, “controller keeps recreating pods”, “why won’t workload stabilize?”*\n",
    "* “Self-healing” is basically: **desired state + controllers + scheduling + kubelet**. If you can explain that loop, you look senior and calm under ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you should sound like**\n",
    "\n",
    "* “I’d identify whether it’s **app crash vs node pressure vs controller behavior**, use events, status conditions, and isolate the failing layer.”\n",

    "## 3) Service Discovery (Very High ROI)\n",
    "\n",
    "**From your TOC**\n",

    "  * kube-proxy, iptables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters for Google TSE scenarios**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Classic scenario: *“Pods are running but the app is unreachable / cannot find peers / intermittent traffic.”*\n",
    "* If you can reason through **Service → Endpoints → kube-proxy rules → DNS**, you can isolate the fault quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you should sound like**\n",
    "\n",
    "* “I’d verify service selectors/endpoints, DNS resolution, readiness effects on endpoints, then kube-proxy behavior and network policy if relevant.”\n",

    "---\n",

    "## 4) Load Balancer (High ROI)\n",

    "**From your TOC (closest matches in this excerpt)**\n",

    "\n",
    "  * kube-proxy mechanisms that underpin service traffic distribution\n",

    "  * (where you’d naturally cover NodePort/LoadBalancer behavior in practice, even if not explicitly listed here)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Common scenario: *“Traffic isn’t distributing / only one pod gets traffic / external access broken.”*\n",
    "* Even if GKE abstracts parts of it, the interviewer wants you to reason through **where load-balancing happens** (service layer vs ingress vs external LB) and what signals prove which layer is failing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you should sound like**\n",
    "\n",
    "* “I’d separate **cluster service routing** (kube-proxy/endpoints) from **external LB/ingress**, and prove where the drop happens using endpoint health + request path tracing.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5) Auto Scaling (High ROI)\n",
    "\n",
    "**From your TOC**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **15 Automatic scaling of pods and cluster nodes**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * 15.1 HPA (CPU, memory, custom metrics, scale-to-zero)\n",
    "  * 15.2 VPA (requests tuning)\n",
    "  * 15.3 Cluster Autoscaler (scale nodes, disruption limits)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it helps in interviews**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scenarios like: *“latency spikes under load”, “pods pending”, “HPA not scaling”, “nodes maxed out.”*\n",
    "* Good TSE answers connect scaling to **metrics, requests/limits, scheduling capacity, and safe scale-down**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you should sound like**\n",
    "\n",
    "* “Before blaming HPA, I’d validate metrics pipeline, confirm requests are sane, check pending reasons, and then evaluate cluster autoscaler capacity.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Others (Must-haves for TSE, even if not in your five buckets)\n",

    "\n",
    "  * requests/limits, QoS, what gets OOM-killed, LimitRange, ResourceQuota, monitoring usage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters**\n",

    "* Many outages are resource-shaped: **OOMKills, CPU throttling, noisy neighbor**, quota misconfig, starvation.\n",
    "* This is **not developer-heavy**; it’s core ops reasoning.\n",

    "* **13 Securing nodes and network**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * security context, privileged, capabilities, network isolation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Google often probes **IAM ↔ RBAC thinking**, least privilege, and “why is this call forbidden?”\n",

    "**From your TOC**\n",
