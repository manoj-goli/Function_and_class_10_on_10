    "## Mock Scenario Question 7: NetworkPolicy + Service Reachability Regression (Vanilla Kubernetes)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You run a self-managed Kubernetes cluster using **Calico** for networking (CNI) and NetworkPolicies. In namespace `prod` you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `web` Deployment (serves HTTP)\n",
    "* `api` Deployment (internal API)\n",
    "* `db` StatefulSet (Postgres)\n",
    "\n",
    "Traffic flow should be:\n",
    "**Ingress → web → api → db**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this morning:\n",
    "\n",
    "* External users intermittently see **500s** on the website.\n",
    "* `web` pods log: `ERROR calling api: connect timeout`\n",
    "* `api` pods log: `ERROR db connection timeout`\n",
    "* All pods are **Running/Ready**.\n",
    "* `kubectl get svc -n prod` looks normal.\n",
    "* You discover a change merged last night: a new **default-deny NetworkPolicy** was applied in `prod`, and a “allow-from-ingress” policy was added for `web`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Give your **step-by-step troubleshooting plan** to isolate the break in the network path and restore service safely. Cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How you prove whether the issue is **DNS**, **Service/Endpoints**, **NetworkPolicy**, or **CNI/kube-proxy**.\n",
    "2. The highest-signal commands you’ll run (be specific) and what you expect to see.\n",
    "3. The minimal safe policy changes you’d apply to restore:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Ingress → web\n",
    "   * web → api\n",
    "   * api → db\n",
    "4. How you validate the fix and prevent recurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask your clarification questions first (I’ll answer short and to the point, like an interviewer). Then give your final response.\n"

    "Desired functionality (intended state):\n",
    "\n",
    "* `prod` should be **default-deny** for both **ingress and egress**.\n",
    "* Only these flows should be allowed:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Ingress controller namespace → `web` pods** on TCP 80/443\n",
    "  2. **`web` pods → `api` pods** on TCP 8080\n",
    "  3. **`api` pods → `db` pods** on TCP 5432\n",
    "* **No other cross-namespace traffic** into `prod` is intended.\n",
    "* DNS should still work (pods should be able to query CoreDNS in `kube-system`).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* A **default-deny** policy was applied in `prod`.\n",
    "* An allow policy was added for **Ingress → web**, but nothing explicit was added for **web → api**, **api → db**, or **DNS egress**.\n"

    "## Score: **6.5 / 10**\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you did well\n",
    "\n",
    "* You correctly identified the likely root cause: **default-deny NetworkPolicy was applied without allowing the needed east-west flows and DNS egress**.\n",
    "* You proposed the right policy intents: **web→api**, **api→db**, and **DNS access**.\n",
    "* You had a sensible “stop the bleeding” instinct (rollback).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What kept it from 9–10/10 (brief)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You didn’t “prove” it with high-signal checks**\n",
    "   In this scenario, a TSE answer should explicitly run 2–3 checks that immediately confirm NetworkPolicy is blocking traffic:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `kubectl get netpol -n prod` (see default-deny + current allow rules)\n",
    "* `kubectl describe netpol -n prod <policy>` (confirm missing egress/ingress selectors)\n",
    "* From pods:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `kubectl exec -n prod <web-pod> -- curl -m2 http://api:8080/health`\n",
    "  * `kubectl exec -n prod <api-pod> -- nc -vz db 5432`\n",
    "  * DNS test: `nslookup api.prod.svc.cluster.local` or `dig`\n",
    "    If DNS works but connect times out → strongly points to NetworkPolicy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **You conflated “roll back” vs “minimal fix”**\n",
    "   Rollback is acceptable as an emergency action, but the question asked for **minimal safe policy changes**. You should show the *least-privilege* patch plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add *only* the missing allows, not “open everything.”\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Missing nuance: egress needs are broader than just db**\n",
    "   Apps often need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* DNS (UDP/TCP 53 to CoreDNS)\n",
    "* sometimes time sync, metrics, external calls\n",
    "  A strong answer mentions starting with the **required flows only** and adding others as observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What a 9/10 answer sounds like (tight)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prove it: show default-deny + missing rules + failing curls from web→api and api→db while pods are Ready.\n",
    "* Apply minimal policies:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Allow ingress-ns → web on 80/443\n",
    "  * Allow web → api on 8080\n",
    "  * Allow api → db on 5432\n",
    "  * Allow DNS egress from prod → kube-system/CoreDNS on 53\n",
    "* Validate: repeat curl/nc + monitor error rate drops.\n",
    "* Prevent recurrence: policy tests in CI (conformance smoke tests), policy templates, staged rollout, and clear label conventions.\n",
